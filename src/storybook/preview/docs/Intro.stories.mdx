## Description

In GAIA components library each component is a package
## How to install components in your project

To install the components in your project:

1. Choose component you would like to install
2. Go to `Npm install` tab
3. Copy command to install the package

⚠️ When install the package please check the warnings in the console regarding peer dependencies and install them if your project doesn't have required packages ⚠️

We recommend to install the next packages and their peerDeps beforehand:

```shell script
npm install @stryberventures/gaia-react.theme @stryberventures/gaia-react.form @stryberventures/gaia-react.text @stryberventures/gaia-react.icons react-jss classnames yup
```

since they are used in most of the components
